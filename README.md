> Host the Vault OAuth redirect URI on a custom domain



When setting up the OAuth connectors for use with Apideck, you have to configure the Apideck Vault redirect URI (https://unify.apideck.com/vault/callback)

Sometimes OAuth connectors require your OAuth redirect URI to be hosted on a domain you own.

This sample project helps you deploy a redirect to https://unify.apideck.com/vault/callback on a custom domain. The redirect will be available as https://mycustom.domain/api/callback.

To deploy this sample, click the **Deploy** button, and configure your domain in Vercel.
